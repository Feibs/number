## Rule

- A number will be inputted on the text box
- When the submit button is pressed, the result will show the difference between the number and its reverse
- The result is always has to be positive
- The input has to be a whole number, cannot be letters or decimals. If the user wants to type in decimals or letters, it won't appear on the input field.

## Example

- Sample #1 = If the number is 21 then the reverse is 12 and the difference is 9
- Sample #2 = If the number is 30 then the reverse is 3 (not 03) and the difference is 27
- Sample #3 = If the number is 1.2 or 1,2 then only shows 12 and the reverse is 21, while the difference is 9
